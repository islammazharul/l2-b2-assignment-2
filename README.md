                                       ----------------------------

1.  Firstly I am using commands in my terminal that contains Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript, Mongoose, CORS, dotenv, Zod, and Bcrypt application.

2.  Navigate to the project directory in my terminal and run the command npm install to install all the required dependencies specified in my package.json file.

3.  Run the command tsc to compile the TypeScript files. This assumes I have TypeScript installed globally or as a dev dependency.

4.  Run the command npm run start:dev to start my Node.js server. Because I use ts-node-dev for auto compiler.

5.  After running the server, check the console for any errors or logs. Fix any issues that may arise.

6.  Use a tool Postman in my browser to test the various endpoints of my application.
    Ensure that the routes defined in my Express application are working as expected.

7.  My application involves a MongoDB database (using Mongoose), ensure that the connection is established successfully.Then the console for any database-related logs or errors.

8.  Make sure that CORS is configured properly to allow requests from my frontend, especially if it's running on a different domain.

9.  Create a .env file in the root of my project and add any necessary environment variables required for my application. Make sure to set values for variables like database connection details.

10. My application involves user authentication using bcrypt, test the authentication flow to ensure users can sign up, log in, and access protected routes.

Now everything is working smoothly, I have successfully run my Node.js application locally.
